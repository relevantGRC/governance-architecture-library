# Governance Frameworks, Standards & Regulations Library
I am a compliance engineer obsessed with implementing structured governance frameworks and building meaningful systems across Information Security and AI.
This repository is a structured, categorized library of global frameworks, standards, and regulatory requirements used in governance, risk management, cybersecurity, privacy, and AI systems.

It is designed to serve as:
- 📚 A compliance reference hub
- 🏗 A governance architecture blueprint
- 🔎 A cross-mapping foundation for ISO, AI, GRC & regulatory programs
- ⚙️ A structured compliance engineering resource
