# ISO Family

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops globally recognized standards that help organizations build structured, reliable, and risk-based management systems.
ISO standards provide a common framework for governance, security, quality, resilience, and emerging technologies. They enable organizations to operate consistently, manage risk effectively, and demonstrate accountability through internationally accepted best practices.
Within Information Security and Artificial Intelligence, some of the most relevant ISO standards include:

- ISO/IEC 27001 – Requirements for establishing an Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- ISO/IEC 27002 – Guidance on implementing information security controls
- ISO/IEC 27005 – Framework for information security risk management
- ISO/IEC 42001 – Requirements for an Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)
  
These standards follow a harmonized structure, making them easier to integrate into a unified governance framework across security, privacy, AI, and risk management domains.
ISO standards are not just compliance tools — they are structured blueprints for building resilient, scalable, and trustworthy systems.
